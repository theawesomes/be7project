# Installation

## Install Git
First, you have to install git.Follow the article: [How to install git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)

## Clone the Repository
[Click here](https://github.com/theawesomes/be7project.git) to open the repository for Handwriting Recognition Project, and copy the git URL.
Now, open terminal in any folder,where you want to clone the repository, and type **git clone copied_URL**, and the project will be cloned to your local PC.

## Install Python

We have used python 2.7 for this project, so make sure to install python **2.7** if you're going to run this project!
Follow: [Download Python2.7 For Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

if you use ubuntu, then type command **sudo apt-get install python** to install python 2.7


## Install Dependencies
You have to install **pygame**, **numpy** and **PIL** which are python libraries, we have used in this project.
For PIL, and numpy, it'll be better if you install **Anaconda**, which contains most of the python libraries.
